    "# PID and MiCS Metal Oxide Semiconductor Sensor Timeseries\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show a small selection of timeseries recorded in our wind tunnel dataset.\n",
    "As with the spatial reconstructions, we focus on one of the sampling experiments, where our 4 sensor probes traverse across the airstream periodically, while the entire gantry slowly steps forward in the direction of the wind. The four probes are mounted vertically above each other with an offset of 24cm, and also traverse up and down, such that we sample a grid of 12x12x8cm cells (see [spatial data notebook](spatial_data.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For some users, the timeseries themselves may be of interest, too. Out dataset contains the full, raw timeseries of all our recordings.\n",
    "Additionally, we perform various preprocessing steps. For example, the raw voltages get converted to sensing element resistances in the case of metal-oxide semiconductor sensors. But we also compute ppm-equivalents of the target gasses, and subtract the background concentrations measured using two upstream sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plots below, we show four interactive plots for the four sensors we used: MiCS 5524, MiCS 6814 (NO2 channel), MiCS 6814 (NH3 channel) and Alphasense PID-AH2.\n",
    "for each plot, you can in your browser zoom into the timeseries as needed, as well as select whether you want to see the raw recorded voltage or the the background-subtracted ppm - the final stage of our preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do note that all signals are filtered with a rolling average filter of 2s, as some of the data is rather noisy, which makes it difficult to discern larger trends. If you require different filtering, you are free to clone this repository and run this notebook again yourself with changed parameters.\n"
